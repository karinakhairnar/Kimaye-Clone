                    <Par>An IIT/IIM/McKinsey Alumnus, Pankaj decided to pursue horticulture. He found this to be an ideal combination of art and science with an ability to make a real difference in the life of farmers. Purnima, an economics graduate and MBA comes from a business family. An entrepreneur at core, Purnima found her passion in building an Indian-origin Global Fruit Brand.</Par>

                    <Par>Way back in 2009, both of them realized that the horticulture sector was highly fragmented and unorganised. The duo was firm about having an integrated value-chain approach with focus on quality over quantity. They chose the 'one fruit at a time' approach over a whole fruit basket and began supplying pomegranates to domestic and international markets. Today, INI has become one of the largest exporter of pomegranates, bananas, and coconuts.</Par>
